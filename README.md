## Code Assistant 

sophisticated tool powered by artificial intelligence that aids developers by providing real-time support and automating various aspects of the coding process

- [continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) - Continue is the leading open-source AI code assistant. You can connect any models and any context to build custom autocomplete and chat experiences inside VS Code and JetBrains.
- [cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) - Autonomous coding agent right in your IDE, capable of creating/editing files, executing commands, using the browser, and more with your permission every step of the way.
- [tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/tree/main) - Tabby is a self-hosted AI coding assistant, offering an open-source and on-premises alternative to GitHub Copilot. Self-contained, with no need for a DBMS or cloud service.OpenAPI interface, easy to integrate with existing infrastructure (e.g Cloud IDE).Supports consumer-grade GPUs.
- [gpt-pilot](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot) - GPT Pilot aims to research how much LLMs can be utilized to generate fully working, production-ready apps while the developer oversees the implementation. The main idea is that AI can write most of the code for an app (maybe 95%), but for the rest, 5%, a developer is and will be needed until we get full AGI.
- [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) - The OG code genereation experimentation platform! GPT-engineer allows you to specify software in natural language, sit back, and watch as an AI writes and executes the code. You can also ask the AI to implement improvements.
